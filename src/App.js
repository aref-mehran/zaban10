  Roya: When I came in, you were reading a book. What was it?
  Mahsa: I was reading a book about famous Iranian scientists.
  Roya: But such books are not very interesting.
  
  Mahsa: At first I had the same idea, believe me!
  Roya: Did you find it useful?
  Mahsa: Oh yes. Actually I learned many interesting things about our scientistsâ€™ lives.
  Roya: Like what?
  Mahsa: For example Razi1 taught medicine to many young people while he was working in Ray Hospital. Or Nasireddin Toosi built Maragheh Observatory when he was studying the planets.
  
  Roya: Cool! What was the name of the book?
  Mahsa: Famous Iranian Scientists.`;
