Today, there are some endangered animals on Earth. It means that we

can find only a few of them around us. Some examples are whales,

Pandas, tigers and Asian elephants.
Humans destroy the natural homes of the animals in the forests,
lakes, and plains. When the number of people on Earth increases, they
need more places for living. They cut down trees and destroy lakes.
They make homes and roads instead. Then the animals won't have a
place to live. They will die out.
The Iranian cheetah is among these animals. This wild animal lives
only in the plains of Iran. Now there are only a few Iranian cheetahs
alive. If people take care of them, there is hope for this beautiful
animal to live.
Recently, families pay more attention
to nature, students learn about saving
wildlife, and some hunters don't go
hunting

anymore.

In

this

way, the
number

of

cheetahs

is going to
increase in the future.

The human body is a real wonder. It is sometimes good to think about
our body and how it works. Our body is doing millions of jobs all the
time.
One of the most important parts of the body is blood. The heart
Pumps this red liquid around the body. This keeps us healthy and alive.
More than half of blood is plasma. This is a clear and yellow liquid.
It carries red and white cells. There are millions of red blood cells
in one small drop of blood. They carry oxygen round the body and
collect carbon dioxide from body parts. There are thousands of white
cells in a drop of blood. They are bigger than red cells. They defend
our body against microbes.
This wonderful liquid is a great gift from Allah. We can thank Allah
by keeping our body healthy. One way to do that is eating healthy food
and doing daily exercises. Another way is to donate our blood to those
who need it.

Human knowledge develops with scientists' hard work. Many great
men and women try hard to f ind facts, solve problems and invent
things.
Some of these scientists did not have easy lives. But they tried hard
when they were working on problems. They never felt weak when they
were studying. They never gave up when they were doing research.
There are great stories about scientists and their lives. One such a story
is about Thomas Edison. As a young boy, Edison was very interested
in science. He was very energetic and always asked questions. Sadly,
young Edison lost his hearing at the age of 12. He did not attend
school and learned science by reading books in the library itself.
When he grew up he worked in different places, but he never lost his
interest in making things. Edison was famous for doing thousands of
experiments to find answers to problems. He said, "I never quit until
I get what I'm after ”. Edison had more than 1,000 inventions
and was very successful at the end of his life.
Many great names had stories like this.
But the key to their success is
their hard work and belief in
themselves. If you want to get
what you want, work hard
and never give up.

A. Read the following texts.

As a tourist, we

should be

careful about our behavior in a foreign
country. We

must not break

any rule if we want to have a good
and safe trip. We

may not like
a part of the host's culture, but we

should be

polite to people and their values. We

should not say

bad
things about their food, dresses, or ceremonies. We

can talk

to
other people and try to understand them. We

should

also

protect

nature and the historical sites of that country. We

must not hurt

animals or plants. We

should not write

anything on buildings. Our
good behavior

can give

a good image of our country to other people.
They

may want

to come and see our country soon!
When people are going abroad, they

must

do

many things

must get
passports and visas. Most often, they
should go

to the
Police to get passports. They

should go

to the embassy of foreign
countries to get visas. They

should

also

become

Familiar with their
destination before their trip. They

can do

that by buying books,
reading booklets, or visiting websites. This

may take

their time.
But it

can help

them a lot. They

may buy

tickets and book hotels
online. Or they

may ask

a travel agency to do that for them. When
Everything is ready, they

can leave

the country safely and enjoy
their trips.
